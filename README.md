**Real-Time Data with Spark**

 This repository documents my hands-on learning journey with Apache Spark Structured Streaming and modern real-time data engineering patterns.

 The goal of this repo is to move beyond theory and build practical, production-style examples using PySpark, Delta Lake, and Databricks concepts.

**🔥 What You'll Find Here**

1. End-to-end Structured Streaming pipelines

2. Batch-to-streaming migration examples

3. Working with Delta tables in streaming

4. Handling late data, watermarks, and checkpoints

5. Real-time aggregations and joins

6. Performance and optimization techniques

7. Experiments with Auto Loader and incremental processing

**🧠 Why This Repo Exists**

As data platforms evolve from batch to real time, understanding streaming architecture is essential for building scalable and reliable data systems. This repo serves as:

✔ A personal knowledge base

✔ A practical reference for real-time Spark patterns

✔ A showcase of applied data engineering skills

**🛠 Tech Stack**

1. PySpark

2. Spark Structured Streaming

3. Delta Lake

4. Databricks (concepts & patterns)

**📌 Status**

This is an evolving learning repository — new scenarios, optimizations, and patterns will be added continuously.
